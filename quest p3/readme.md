For this assignment we have built a usefull scafold for making a full adventure game.
We can draw maps, have npc´s and pickups, give feadback to the player etc.
But this code still has some sharpe edges, duplicated code, magic things and missing features etc. it needs some love.

Each featrure we are asking for is uncomplicated if you consider them one at a time and keep focused on that spesific job.
You can quickly become overwhelmed if trying to do more than one thing at a time. Start with a task that dosent requier to much new code (new NPC is a low hanging fruit).
Best of luck.

Remember: 
* That you are to use this code, not replace it with something completly diffrent.
* Do not use AI, it will only make you sad.
* You might not be able to complete all the features, that is ok.
* We are not asking you to do anything that there **isn't** already code in the project for. It might do something else, but it is **conceptually** the code you need. Alternativly you have been given the code in a diffrent project.
* The comments can be removed or kept, they are there mostly to suport peeps that have not been to class



## So you are to add the following features

* Splash screen, This is a screen that is shown for a litle while before the menu is shown.
* Menu, Create a menu with some meaningfull choices.
* 2 new levels (how do you go frome one to the other)
* 2 new NPC´s that are conceptualy diffrent from the zombies in some meaningfull way.
* Potion, Poison and elixiers with time duration. 
* Trapps
* Teleportation i.e the player moves from one place on the map to a diffrent place by interacting.
* Pickups like swords, axes etc that change the player character visualy and functionaly.
* Display what is in the players inventory. 


## Bonus:
* Sliding window
